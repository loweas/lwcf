Though the DinoTracks site is currently undeveloped, it holds immense educational and outdoor recreational potential as the future southern trailhead of the 500-mile state-long Rio Grande Trail and Western terminus of the 60-mile county-long Rio Grande Trail. During the past three years, Insights has worked with over 100 volunteers to improve educational access to the site.  As a result, we provide guided educational hiking tours for thousands annually. Guided tours of the DinoTracks site offer an approachable, fun, and educational introduction to outdoor recreation for tour guests who often have little experience hiking.\nUnfortunately, visitors to the undeveloped site currently have no shade and Insights staff have no means of equipment storage on site. With 300 days per year of full desert sun, the lack of shade and water storage presents a serious safety concern for visiting families.  With your support, we will build a Safe Shade Outdoor Classroom to provide access to shade and educational programing about the dangers of UV radiation.  Access to this space provides tour guests, many of which are taking their first hike, with the information needed to protect their families from the desert sun.  Including a small sturdy storage area in the Safe Shade outdoor classroom structure will allow Insights to store trail maintenance tools, educational materials to provide interactive educational activities during tours, tables and chairs for events, extra water bottles, and a first aid kit onsite. Breaking ground for the Safe Shade structure will initiate an exciting period of development for long term outdoor recreation investment in this high need region of Southern Dona Ana county, NM.\n", "Q29": "Sunland Park, NM", "Q7": "New Mexico State Parks \/ Private nonprofit", "Q8": "Developing recreational areas, trails, and waterways,Enhancing access to national parks, forests, wildlife refuges, and other public lands,Preserving historic battlefields and cultural sites,Safeguarding rivers, watershed, water supplies, and clean water,Preserving natural areas and wildlife habitat,Creating and improving state and local parks,Supporting local economies and jobs through increased outdoor recreation,Increasing park access in urban settings,Other (please describe):", "Q8_10_TEXT": "Outdoor Education", "Q9": "Other (please describe):", "Q9_9_TEXT": "Private land working with NM State Parks", "Q31": "Development", "Q10": "Infrastructure (parking areas, electrical, roads, ADA accessibility, shelters, water treatment, waste management)", "Q28": "NA", "Q13": "$1,750,000+", "Q14_1": "NA", "Q15": "Backpacking\/Hiking,Biking,Campground + Hospitality,Wildlife Watching,Other (please describe):", "Q15_14_TEXT": "Paleontology", "Q20": "Rural,Urban,Low-income,Communities of color,Immigrants,Tribal\/Native American,Youth,Adults,Senior,Disabled", "Q20_11_TEXT": "NA", "Q22": "New concept", "Q27": "Yes", "Q30": "NA", "Q21": "Yes", "Q26": "Concrete, design, and coordination have all been donated - the safe shade project is shovel ready.

Cristo Rey trail, Rio Grande Trails, and Paso del Norte trail networks.  Beyond providing shade and UV education to DinoTracks tour guests, the Safe Shade structure will also serve as the very first physical infrastructure constructed at the DinoTracks site and regional trail hub.  An initial ribbon cutting ceremony demonstrates the State of New Mexico’s long term commitment to foster outdoor recreation opportunities in one of the most remote regions of the state and will generate public enthusiasm for the construction of both Rio Grande and Paso del Norte regional trail networks. \nThanks to the support of State Senator Jeff Steinborn and State Representative Raymundo Lara, $50,000 in funding for a study to determine the feasibility constructing a visitor center at the DinoTracks site as the southern terminus of the Rio Grande Trail was included in the 2019 New Mexico state budget.  During the past year, a bid was awarded to the Sites Southwest company and the feasibility study was initiated in the summer of 2020.  The study is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.  Insights is working closely with Sites Southwest to ensure that our existing trail networks, educational resources, and 5-year plans for the site are incorporated into the study.  Though much public support and initial segment construction investments for the Rio Grande Trail have been made in Northern New Mexico, far fewer residents are aware of the recreational and economic value of this tail project.  Breaking ground with the safe shade structure initiates an exciting period of development for ecotourism and long term outdoor recreation investments in this largely high need region. \n" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -106.8349691, 32.3499198 ] } },
