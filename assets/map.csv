Wildlife Observation Tower on the Rio Grande,,New Mexico,City of Sunland Park,New Mexico,Doña Ana County,Development,"Infrastructure (parking areas, electrical, roads, ADA accessibility, shelters, water treatment, waste management)","The City of Sunland Park is proposing to build a small wildlife observation tower in one of the local City parks. It will be located right on the Rio Grande River where it can provide a plethora of wildlife viewing from avian to megafauna species. This will attract both wildlife enthusiast and people from surrounding areas to visit and stimulate
the economy in Sunland Park. It will also be the first environmentally-oriented project developed in the City to provide residents with an avenue to become ecologically oriented with their surroundings. The specifications of the tower include a large enough platform to fit about four people at a time. It has to have an ADA Ramp as well as a staircase to the tower top for both easy and equitable access to residents. The tower will also have a roof to protect against inclement weather as long as it is financially feasible. The material would be made of wood or another heat resistant category to reflect the hot summer temperatures. It is approximated that the tower will be around
50 feet tall, or enough to get an adequate view of the landscape.",FY22,City of Sunland Park,City of Sunland Park,,State and Local Assistance,,"$0 - $250,000",75000,Wildlife Watching,,"Rural,Urban,Low-income,Black Americans,Communities of color,LGBTQ,Immigrants,Tribal/Native American,Youth,Adults,Senior,Disabled",New Concept,Yes,,No,,"$0 - $250,000","The proposed project is directly in line with both the New Mexico Outdoor Recreation Division and the Statewide
Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan as it increases equitable access to outdoor activities for New Mexico
Residents. Currently, there is no environmentally-centered projects in the City and this one would be the first of its kind.
This would fulfill a gap in environmental education and recreation for residents. The resultants from this project will be
an increased awareness of ecology, the environment, and the environmental health of the City. It will also be an
economic driver as it will attract other visitors from surrounding areas to come visit and spend their money in Sunland
Park. Plus, the proposed wildlife observation tower would be one of the only ones (if not the only one) in the
surrounding area, so it would be a highly attractive visitation site.","Both the City of Sunland Park and its Mayor have approved and fully supported the project. Overall, the wildlife observation tower will be made well in order to ensure structural integrity for years to come. Regular light maintenance will be conducted by City of Sunland Park staff (this includes cleaning, trash collection, etc.). Any occasional heavy maintenance will be done by the construction company or a hired professional entity.",Both the City of Sunland Park and its Mayor have approved and fully supported the project. No other entities are aware of the project.,"The City of Sunland Park is located on the outskirts of the City of El Paso. Sunland Park is largely a low income
community and a large population of our residents live in poverty (according to the population estimates of the 2019
U.S. Census Bureau, the persons in poverty rate is 38.8%). The project proposed is the first environmentally-driven
idea in the City of Sunland Park. This outlet provides residents an avenue to observe their natural area from above. If
completed, this milestone will set the foundation of respect to protect and preserve the ecology and overall
environment in Sunland Park.

Also, the City intends to improve youth outdoor access through this project. The City of Sunland Park serves a large portion of low income residents. According to the local school district Gadsden Independent School District), 100% of the youth in attendance are in a free or reduced lunch program. This decision is based on their parents' income and poverty level. The wildlife observation tower project will provide an outdoor education and recreation hotspot that is currently not available to the youth of Sunland Park. In turn, this will eventually increase youth participation and knowledge in environmental protection and preservation in their City."
