The Alpine tunnel was at one time the highest (11,523’) railroad tunnel on the continent. On the west side of the tunnel a 452’ long by 33’ high dry stack stone wall was constructed along a 300’ high cliff to support the track.  This engineering wonder was quickly named the Palisade Wall. This route was considered an engineering marvel in its day attracting tourists from around the globe seeking the thrill of riding this train under the mountains and along the cliffs.  Since 1911 the former grade (hiking trail on the east side and motorized trail on the west side) has been a popular attraction. GNF estimates 1,000 visitors per month in the prime summer months. In 2016 a snow avalanche destroyed a 50’ long segment of the Palisade Wall road closing access to the historic Alpine Tunnel site to all, but those able to make the 7 mile hike.

Three community visioning meetings were held, and a Trails Task Force (TTF) was formed, including representatives from TOS, Sn Juan County, San Juan Regional Planning Commission, San Juan Development Association, Silverton Area Chamber of Commerce, Mountain Studies Institute, Hardrock Hundred Endurance Run and Silverton Singletrack Society (SSS). The TTF held a series of nine meetings and focus group sessions to distill the information gathered in the visioning meetings into a draft plan. After presenting the draft plan for community input, a final trails master plan was submitted to Town and County governments for adoption in February 2019, and was approved unanimously by both governing bodies. The plan was then shared with the BLM and USFS for use in their planning processes.
 
Among the 14 different trail projects identified in the 2019 SATP is a bike optimized trail network proposed by SSS. Originally referenced as “Project #7, Storm Peak Massif Purpose Built, Bike Optimized Trail System,” the project is now dubbed the Baker’s Park Trail System after an early moniker for the Town of Silverton. The inclusion of mountain biking in the 2019 SATP represents a significant shift in thinking from the 2004 plan, which did not address this user group.

Public comment on the 2019 SATP, and by extension for Baker’s Park, was accepted from 12/15/18 - 1/15/19 via email, paper comment forms, and an online form. A total of 216 responses were received from both residents and visitors of Silverton and San Juan County. 78% of responses were fully in favor of the proposed SATP, 17% were mostly in favor, 4% were mostly opposed, and 1% were fully opposed. Opposition centered mainly around concerns for the environment, wildlife and cultural resources, all of which will be addressed through the BLM’s Travel Management Plan process which includes a rigorous review and evaluation for potential environmental, cultural, and resource impacts, as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). More information about the trails process, the final draft of the 2019 SATP and all public comment are available at this link: https://townofsilverton.colorado.gov/community-visioning. The full Baker’s Park Concept Plan can be accessed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eEJOV5GKELVPz17PGetitFgjPoBY5YNV. 
","The BLM recently finalized its Travel Management Plan for the Silverton area, and the Baker's Park Trail System was included in this plan, minus one trail that was eliminated due to wildlife concerns. San Juan County has agreed to serve as the applicant for a number of SSS grant applications for Baker's Park. The Town of Silverton is currently considering a funding request for 2021.","The BLM has partnered with SSS on a number of trail maintenance projects and has been steadfast in its support of the SSS plan to develop these bike optimized trails. To ensure the continuation of this partnership, SSS is pursuing a Volunteer Agreement with the BLM to be able to continue with trail maintenance independently. San Juan County has been an early and ongoing supporter of the Bakers Park Concept Plan, contributing $11,000 towards the IMBA study, unanimously adopting the 2019 SATP, and pledging in-kind support. The Town of Silverton has also signaled its support through unanimous adoption of the 2019 SATP, the coordination of the trails planning process, a $5,000 donation and $10,000 pledge, plus the promise of in-kind assistance. Continued partnership and cooperation from these partners is expected to continue as the Baker’s Park project moves forward.","As the only incorporated town in SJC, Silverton is an isolated rural community of approximately 700 year-round residents. Formerly a bustling mining town, when the last hard rock mine closed in 1992, the loss of this key industry brought economic hardship to the community. The town has reinvented itself through tourism, relying heavily on the summer season (June – September) and the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad as economic drivers. The winter economy is slowly growing after the establishment of Silverton Mountain in 2002. However, once the train stops running in October, many business owners board up their windows and leave town until spring. This creates a seasonal boom/bust cycle, making it difficult for the community to attract and retain new residents and businesses, or to support the public services and facilities found in larger, more economically vibrant communities. To access basic services like health care, banks, and grocery stores or youth enrichment activities like recreation centers, pools or sports leagues, local families must drive 50 – 60 miles over treacherous mountain passes. 

Diversification of the tourism economy and the development of trails as a recreational asset have been identified as key goals in a number of different community planning documents. We believe that development of non-motorized trails will create an economic driver for the shoulder seasons that is on par with summer, and that offering more year-round recreational opportunities in the area will provide an amenity to attract and retain new year-round businesses and residents. Additional desired outcomes include better access to recreation opportunities for our local population, and promoting healthy lifestyles through outdoor recreation.

It is worth noting that most of the trails accessible to Silverton residents without a car ride are unmaintained mining roads, railroad grades and pack mule trails. These routes are steep, prone to washouts and often become braided as users seek an easier way down. The majority are rideable only by advanced and expert level mountain bikers. Baker’s Park will provide a more well-rounded experience for riders of all levels while minimizing resource damage with properly built, easy to maintain trails. Concerns about user conflict raised through recent community visioning meetings can also be addressed through Baker’s Park by providing discrete places for mountain bikers to ride.

Though the DinoTracks site is currently undeveloped, it holds immense educational and outdoor recreational potential as the future southern trailhead of the 500-mile state-long Rio Grande Trail and Western terminus of the 60-mile county-long Rio Grande Trail. During the past three years, Insights has worked with over 100 volunteers to improve educational access to the site.  As a result, we provide guided educational hiking tours for thousands annually. Guided tours of the DinoTracks site offer an approachable, fun, and educational introduction to outdoor recreation for tour guests who often have little experience hiking.
Unfortunately, visitors to the undeveloped site currently have no shade and Insights staff have no means of equipment storage on site. With 300 days per year of full desert sun, the lack of shade and water storage presents a serious safety concern for visiting families.  With your support, we will build a Safe Shade Outdoor Classroom to provide access to shade and educational programing about the dangers of UV radiation.  Access to this space provides tour guests, many of which are taking their first hike, with the information needed to protect their families from the desert sun.  Including a small sturdy storage area in the Safe Shade outdoor classroom structure will allow Insights to store trail maintenance tools, educational materials to provide interactive educational activities during tours, tables and chairs for events, extra water bottles, and a first aid kit onsite.

Beyond providing shade and UV education to DinoTracks tour guests, the Safe Shade structure will also serve as the very first physical infrastructure constructed at the DinoTracks site and regional trail hub.  An initial ribbon cutting ceremony demonstrates the State of New Mexico’s long term commitment to foster outdoor recreation opportunities in one of the most remote regions of the state and will generate public enthusiasm for the construction of both Rio Grande and Paso del Norte regional trail networks. 
Thanks to the support of State Senator Jeff Steinborn and State Representative Raymundo Lara, $50,000 in funding for a study to determine the feasibility constructing a visitor center at the DinoTracks site as the southern terminus of the Rio Grande Trail was included in the 2019 New Mexico state budget.  During the past year, a bid was awarded to the Sites Southwest company and the feasibility study was initiated in the summer of 2020.  The study is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.  Insights is working closely with Sites Southwest to ensure that our existing trail networks, educational resources, and 5-year plans for the site are incorporated into the study.  Though much public support and initial segment construction investments for the Rio Grande Trail have been made in Northern New Mexico, far fewer residents are aware of the recreational and economic value of this tail project.

Valencia Soil and Water Conservation District support local environmental education through programs that are directly aligned to the state standards and allow students to interact with their environment either at our location: Whitfield Wildlife Conservation Area or at their school or home backyards. These activities are designed for place based learning and tools to get kids to find new ways to learn outside and grow in that knowledge for a pathway to stewardship. During non Covid times, these programs visit students in the classroom and then on site afterward for an extension. During Covid times, these programs are created in 15 minute videos sent to students with a 15 minute activity students do at school and in their backyards. Then students interact with me over a zoom meeting to show me the results of their activity.

I have created nature based resource grant opportunities for local public schools in Valencia County to be able to apply for up to $1,000.00 for resources to support their program and their students to find new ways to interact with the local environment during this time. This grant is a first come, first serve opportunity and will remain open until funding is depleted.
