As an envisioned Waystation for Continental Divide Trail hikers, the Waterworks project is dedicated to supporting entrepreneurial opportunities and fostering a strong recreational economy to grow and retain local businesses. Once renovated, the Waterworks building will include a museum and space for workforce training and developing entrepreneurship.

A public site for camping and event activities is currently in development at the Waterworks location, with amenities including composting toilets, solar showers, outdoor kitchen, and service businesses.

This project collaborates with Grant County communities and organizations to promote equitable access, connectivity, and development, maintaining trails and open space for public health, well-being, and economic vitality. The Waterworks site is the blueprint model for connecting the Five Points Initiative community cultural and historic sites linked by trails and green spaces.

The project will provide a vital outdoor education venue for local schools.  The proposed Silva Creek trail will continue to be developed, connecting the Waterworks site to area schools, local businesses and recreational services; providing equitable access and inviting youth and families to engage in healthy physical activity.

Though the DinoTracks site is currently undeveloped, it holds immense educational and outdoor recreational potential as the future southern trailhead of the 500-mile state-long Rio Grande Trail and Western terminus of the 60-mile county-long Rio Grande Trail. During the past three years, Insights has worked with over 100 volunteers to improve educational access to the site.  As a result, we provide guided educational hiking tours for thousands annually. Guided tours of the DinoTracks site offer an approachable, fun, and educational introduction to outdoor recreation for tour guests who often have little experience hiking.
Unfortunately, visitors to the undeveloped site currently have no shade and Insights staff have no means of equipment storage on site. With 300 days per year of full desert sun, the lack of shade and water storage presents a serious safety concern for visiting families.  With your support, we will build a Safe Shade Outdoor Classroom to provide access to shade and educational programing about the dangers of UV radiation.  Access to this space provides tour guests, many of which are taking their first hike, with the information needed to protect their families from the desert sun.  Including a small sturdy storage area in the Safe Shade outdoor classroom structure will allow Insights to store trail maintenance tools, educational materials to provide interactive educational activities during tours, tables and chairs for events, extra water bottles, and a first aid kit onsite. Breaking ground for the Safe Shade structure will initiate an exciting period of development for long term outdoor recreation investment in this high need region of Southern Dona Ana county, NM.

Beyond providing shade and UV education to DinoTracks tour guests, the Safe Shade structure will also serve as the very first physical infrastructure constructed at the DinoTracks site and regional trail hub.  An initial ribbon cutting ceremony demonstrates the State of New Mexico’s long term commitment to foster outdoor recreation opportunities in one of the most remote regions of the state and will generate public enthusiasm for the construction of both Rio Grande and Paso del Norte regional trail networks.
Thanks to the support of State Senator Jeff Steinborn and State Representative Raymundo Lara, $50,000 in funding for a study to determine the feasibility constructing a visitor center at the DinoTracks site as the southern terminus of the Rio Grande Trail was included in the 2019 New Mexico state budget.  During the past year, a bid was awarded to the Sites Southwest company and the feasibility study was initiated in the summer of 2020.  The study is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.  Insights is working closely with Sites Southwest to ensure that our existing trail networks, educational resources, and 5-year plans for the site are incorporated into the study.  Though much public support and initial segment construction investments for the Rio Grande Trail have been made in Northern New Mexico, far fewer residents are aware of the recreational and economic value of this tail project.  Breaking ground with the safe shade structure initiates an exciting period of development for ecotourism and long term outdoor recreation investments in this largely high need region.

The Zuni reservation no longer has a running river, almost all the lakes are dry and depressing. Our goal here at the Fish & Wildlife department is to develope water resources available to fish and wildlife big, medium, and small with no discrimination. With the hopes of these water developments we wish to increase the water table to the region or area that is being improved which will then help with improving the surrounding habitat to recruit better flora and fauna to the region or area. Some of the lakes we have on the reservation are spring fed so making improvements as far as feeding the lakes with water year round to keep from drying and stocked with fish is the ultimate goal for recreational fishing.

The Future Angler Foundation (FAF) is an incorporated 501(c)(3) non-profit organization formed in April of 2012 by a small group of anglers dedicated to help grow the sport of fishing through education and outreach.

The FAF works to “Create New Anglers” by working with individuals and organizations throughout the United States to expose potential new anglers of all ages to the sport of fishing and educate them on how to catch fish and protect the resource.  The educational component of what the FAF does is critical to the future of the sport because equipment alone will not catch fish, each angler must have the knowledge needed to use the equipment effectively.  Additionally, with the introduction of Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) in the U.S, anglers must know the part they must play in slowing the spread of AIS if we are to protect our lakes and streams for future generations.  As such, the FAF partners with state and federal agencies and other conservation oriented non-profits to assist in educating anglers on how to become successful anglers and on the steps they need to take as stewards of the water to slow the spread of AIS.

The FAF utilizes angler education and outreach to help reverse the attrition that is currently taking place in the sportfishing, and support industry R3 efforts.  We are able to do so through the use of networking and hands on grassroots approach that has proven to be extremely effective.  It is our opinion that participation in outdoor activities like fishing are at the core of the American way of life and essential to the future of our nation as we know it.

Specifically the FAF works to:
•	Support events that volunteers host by providing written material, fishing equipment and items that will support an increase in participation in the sport.
•	Create an infrastructure to support accomplished angler volunteers to educate anglers of all experience levels at venues like National Parks, National Forests, State Parks, State Forests, and Federal/State Wildlife areas and angling events.
•	Develop programs to bring angling into the schools as part of a school curriculum.  FAF volunteers donate time to train the teachers and FAF can assist in the funding of the equipment needed for these programs.
•	The FAF with financial support provided through a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service grant administered by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies has contracted the Emmy award winning “Into the Outdoors” television network to create a video series and corresponding educational curriculum targeted at grade school and middle school age students to teach them about angling.  This series is currently being produced and will be introduced in 2019. Upon completion is will be available through their “free source” network at the following link: Getting Families Fishing or for classroom curriculum  www.kidsfishing.us
•	Provide individuals and organizations funding and equipment to support programs those individuals and organizations are currently using to grow participation in the sport.
•	FAF hosts a website designed to expose the work FAF supported volunteers are doing to educate anglers of all ages.  Additionally the site shares the passion our Members have for the sport through video and images of our Members participating in the events we are funding.
•	Works with the fishing industry in a manner that will garner support for the FAF’s mission to educate anglers of all ages and is active in support of AREA.

The Future Angler Foundation is an all-volunteer organization, currently having no paid employees. Funding is provided by partner contributions, donations from the general public, donations from businesses, grants from government agencies and grants from other nonprofit organizations.

The FAF has no investments or real-estate assets. The FAF activities are summarized below, with estimated percentages of resource (cost and volunteers’ time) allocation:

•	35% Equipment/support materials given to attendees by volunteers at  educational events
•	45% Production costs for “Getting Families Fishing” Video Series/Curriculum
•	15%   Grant Administration, communication, accounting, record keeping, and Futureangler.org web site(webmaster functions, content creation, social media)
•	5% Travel expense to attend angling related educational conferences and trade shows

The FAF is managed by its board of directors who are opinion leaders in areas such as AIS prevention, industry advocacy, angler education and sales/marketing experts. The board includes: Patrick Neu-FAF President & NPAA Executive Director and past industry sales/marketing professional; Kevin VanDam, professional bass anglings most recognized angler and accomplished tackle/marine industry businessman;  past president of the National Marine Manufacturers Assoc., Thom Dammrich who has also served on numerous boating/fishing industry association board of directors;  Sam Calabro, avid angler/past sales/marketing executive at Union Pacific Railroad who is acting as the FAF’s Vice President-Industry Relations; retired U.S. Forest Service Aquatic Biologist Dr. Robert (Nick) Schmal, acting as FAF Governmental Partnership Liaison; Dr. Phil Moy a former U.W. Sea Grant Director and active aquatic biologist;  industry association manager; Robert Blosser, pro angler/opinion leader and successful business person. Day to day management is undertaken on a volunteer basis by FAF President, Patrick Neu and a recently hired independent contractor, Ashley Garland owner of Garland Management LLC, who will administer grant support and execution.

Our passion for the sport and our desire to share angling as a life changing activity with future anglers through education and outreach is the driving force behind the formation of this foundation. We truly believe that by exposing non-anglers to sportfishing and at the same time reactivating anglers who have not participated in the sport recently, we can solidify a place for sportfishing in our American culture for generations to come. We hope that you will join us in our mission to grow the sport of fishing through education and outreach by donating to the Future Angler Foundation today!
